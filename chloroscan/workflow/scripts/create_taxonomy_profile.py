    # Tips for changing the output for our krona tools:
    # 1. Shifting the count of taxonomy to the count of contig magnitudes + the official format of krona tools to work on.
    # 2. try to get the magnitude for each contig and then go for it. 
    # 3. Here is the problem: If you only use count of taxa found, it gives you how precise corgi did to classify each contig.
    #    But, adding the magnitude of contigs by its depth, can adjust the abundance to make it precise.
